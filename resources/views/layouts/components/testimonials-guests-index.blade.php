                                <p>I have found it to be a hotel of historical importance and experienced the feel of walled city of Lahore. My stay was very comfortable and food was exquisite. It made me go back in time and to feel the 100 years old heritage of the building. The services were good and I will definitely recommend it to other people as it was the best place to stay in Lahore.</p>
